Assume a pandas dataframe df_cars which when printed is as shown below. Based on this information, answer questions 2 and 3. 
2. Of the following set of statements, which of them can be used to extract the column Type as a separate data frame?
  df_cars[[’Type’]]
  df_cars.iloc[[:, 1]
  df_cars.loc[:, [’Type’]]
  None of the above

Ans: df_cars[[’Type’]]
     df_cars.loc[:, [’Type’]]

3. The method df_cars.describe() will give description of which of the following column?
  Car name                         
  Brand
  Price (in lakhs)
  All of the above

Ans: Price (in lakhs)

4. Which pandas function is used to stack the dataframes vertically?

  pd.concat()
  join()
  None of the above

Ans: pd.concat()

5. Which of the following are libraries in Python?

Ans: All of the above

Read the comma-separated values file  hotel bookings.csv  as a dataframe data hotel and answer questions 6 - 8. 
Please refer to Hotel Bookings  Data Description.pdf  for data and variable description.

6. Choose the appropriate command(s) to filter those booking details whose reservation-status are a No-show?

Ans:  2nd Option: & 4th Option
data_hotel_ns = data_hotel[data_hotel.reservation_status == ‘No-Show’]
data_hotel_ns = data_hotel.loc[data_hotel.reservation_status.isin([‘No-Show’])]

7. From the same data, find how many bookings were not canceled in the year 2017?
  9064
  6231
  9046
  None of the above

Ans: 9064

code:
data_hotel = pd.read_csv("D:\\Nivedha YouTube Videos copied to PHD 2021-08-19 added many after that\Data Science MCQs\Assignment 3 2023\hotel_bookings.csv")
not_cancelled=data_hotel[data_hotel.is_canceled==0]
not_cancelled_2017_1=not_cancelled[not_cancelled.arrival_date_year==2017]
no_of_rows=not_cancelled_2017_1.shape[0] #shape returns a tuple (no.of rows, no. of col.) 
not_cancelled_2017_2 = data_hotel[(data_hotel.is_canceled==0)&(data_hotel.arrival_date_year==2017)]


8. From the total bookings that were made in 2017 and not canceled, which month had the highest number of repeated guests?
  July
  February
  January
  None of the above

Ans: January

Code:
grouped = not_cancelled_2017_1.groupby(["arrival_date_month", "is_repeated_guest"])
#grouped is an object created by groupby method
df_rows_in_group = grouped.size().reset_index(name="counts") 
#size of each group i.e no. of rows is provided. Creates a new column 'counts' 
repeated_guests = df_rows_in_group[df_rows_in_group.is_repeated_guest == 1]
month_with_highest_repeated_guests = repeated_guests.loc[repeated_guests["counts"].idxmax()].arrival_date_month


9. What will be the output of the following code?
  
  [bool, int, float, float, str]
  [str, int, float, float, str]
  [bool, int, float, int, str]
  [bool, int, int, float, str]

Ans: [bool, int, float, float, str]

10. Which command is used to generate the plot shown below?
   plt.plot(x, linestyle = “-”)
  plt.plot(x, linestyle = “–”)
  plt.plot(x, linestyle = “-.”)
  plt.plot(x, linestyle = “:”)

Ans: 2nd option
plt.plot(x, linestyle = “–”)
